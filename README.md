## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.



## Plan

### Main tasks:
 
- Build menu;
  -- Scroll to section on link click
- Add functionality to distinguish the section in view;
  -- Set sections as active
- Add the functionality to scroll to sections.
- REFACTOR;
- Test the performance;

### Suggested tasks:
 - Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
 - Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
            Hint: setTimeout can be used to check when the user is no longer scrolling.
 - Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of    the page.
 - Update/change the design/content.
 - Make sections collapsible.
